Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  I was given a starter code which revolved around the Pirate Intelligent Agent Specifications, I was supposed to fully understand what was required through reviewing the specifications. And I was supposed to use Deep Q-learning to train the pirate agent to navigate through the game world and to find the tresure, ensuring that the code would run without any issues. 
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  I think computer science is a very interdisciplinary course revolving around different tasks that stem from different fields. There is coding, programming, analysis and much more, involved in the process of computer science. I think the main purpose is to analyze a problem, and be able to find possible solutions for those areas. 
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  Considering that I also have a concentration in data analytics, I think the most crucial way to solve problems is to analyze the different basis and components of the problem, in order to truly know how to solve problems. 
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  I should always ensure that whatever I am doing, I should always be in align with the specifications or the users or the parties that are involved. I should ensure that security and privacy is always considered when it comes to computer science and data analytics.
